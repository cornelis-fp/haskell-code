##Chapter One

### Opening



*I shall not furnish you with an itinerary for I know very well that you will regard my intentions rash and fraught with danger, and therefore, send someone after me. I have not divulged my plans to anyone; neither mama nor aunt Sabina have any knowledge of my directions. You may be consoled, sir, to discover that I go not with or in pursuit of a man, or the love of a man. Marriage is far from my mind, and may it long remain so. My endeavours are entirely selfish, much in keeping with my character. You may go east or west, to the Continent, the Outer Hebrides, or the Americas, or closer to home; you shall have small chance of finding me. As a concession to you, I shall continue to write my* Letter from the Continent *which I shall dispatch directly to the editor and not, as before, via your intermediary. Reading between the lines you might get a clue of my last location.*

~~

Frieda reads over the last paragraph, closes the letter with all her love and affection, and signs it with the flourish of one having reached her majority just a fortnight ago. She folds the sheet with care, seals the letter and directs it to Mr Frank Marlowe of Hill Street in London.

~~

She put it to the ordinary post on Monday, the 17th of September. That same day, she boarded a hired carriage in the company of her lady’s maid, Miss Guthrie, and her manservant, Rupert, and travelled south. Her letter will arrive three days later and be the cause of much consternation.

### Frank goes to Sabina’s house

Frank Marlowe calls on his sister, Mrs Sabina Gascoyne, at Devonshire Street. Not wishing to waste time waiting for a carriage, he goes on foot, covering the mile and a quarter on foot in twenty minutes. He encounters Sabina at her bureau where she has retired to after breakfast. She is somewhat surprised to see him breeze into her private sitting room at this time of day. They exchange familial pleasantries; he acquaints her with the purpose of his visit. Sabina is shocked by the news he has brought. They talk animatedly about Frieda’s extraordinary letter – not the first time the girl has surprised them with something so wholly unexpected. But this must be the most radical of all her previous enterprises, all of which, it has to be said, led to a misfortune of some sort before they were finally resolved.

While they are conversing, an event in May, when a distraught Frieda came to see her about a most distressing matter, keeps intruding on Sabina’s thoughts; she cannot get it out of her mind for she has a nagging premonition that this letter might in some way be connected with that thorny subject. And so, giving a sudden turn to their conversation, she says,

‘Have you told her yet who her real father is, Frank?’

‘No.’

‘Oh, you fool! Can you not see that Frieda is wise enough to have discovered the truth for herself?’ Sabina does not give her brother the benefit of a reply. ‘Well, in view of what’s happened, with Frieda gone off heaven knows where! – I shall have to enlighten you: she confronted Claire and demanded to know. Your precious Claire then asked her daughter what was to be done next, and her answer was emphatic: “Let *him* tell me, when he is ready to do so.” So, there you are brother, dear. Besides, she has sworn Claire and I to secrecy; but, as I said, with Frieda gone – which I don’t think she would have done without your approval, had you come clean with her – I cannot be quiet any longer. I only hope Claire will forgive me for breaking my promise to Frieda.’

Frank sighs; takes his sister’s hand in his. ‘I’m sorry. I was going to. I kept delaying: I wanted to first consult with Claire, to wait till Frieda is a bit older – but, I don’t know. By god! Sabina, that child has grown up so quickly; she has outstripped our understanding of her at every possible turn.’ He pauses to reflect on the extraordinary prodigy that is Frieda. ‘We – I must find her, Sabina. I shall never be able to forgive myself if she should come to harm. Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear.’ He sighs again, thinking. ‘I shall go to Mansfield and co. – they *must* know something.’

‘Who is Mansfield?’

‘Her attorney.’

‘She’s got her own attorney, does she?’ Sabina laughs. ‘Yes, of course she does. That’s our Frieda for you, Frank. And you know what? Whatever it is she’s got into, she’ll know damn well what she has let herself in for; and, if she doesn’t know the full import of her actions, as yet, you can be sure she is quite able to deal with each predicament with her usual panache.’

‘Don’t pretend you are not concerned for her safety, Sabina. You have been the most caring godmother any child could ever have wished for. You’ll be worried sick, I vouch.’

‘Yes, I shall – every minute of the day, till she’s safely back with us. But you, my dear and supremely intelligent brother, must do all you can to recover her. Never has there been a Marlowe in this family of greater significance than Frieda, and you shall see to it that she comes back to us safe and sound.’



**

 

### Frank goes to Frieda’s attorney

‘I’ve come, sir, to enquire after Miss Marlowe, until a month ago my ward and prime concern in life. I should be grateful if you can provide me with information on her present whereabouts. I’ve had a letter stating she has taken off in pursuit of a quest the details of which are obscure to me. If you can enlighten me on that score, too, I shall be much obliged to you.’

Mr Mansfield has received his not-altogether unexpected caller directly he was announced by the clerk. He regards Mr Marlowe with a measure of satisfaction. Miss Frieda Marlowe has been a client of his for only a few months – since her curious enquiries after the well-being of a long-standing client of his, Mr Jonathan Ward, a rich merchant trader from Brazil who, mysteriously, seems to have vanished from the face of the earth. Miss Marlowe made a very tolerable first impression on him, and he on her, it appears; so that, when she applied to him for legal advice on financial matters of her own, he accepted her as a client with alacrity. He delights in being of service to people of superior wit: persons such as she excite him and make his profession all the more rewarding. Miss Marlowe’s wealth, when he came to be entrusted with her wherewithal, has come as a pleasant surprise. All the more reason to treasure such a client, and earn her trust completely. Looking at the man sitting across from him, he is struck by the likeness, the distinct similarity in tone and attitude. The attorney smiles inwardly, adjusting his portly frame to the contours of his office fauteuil.

‘You come straight to the point, Mr Marlowe. Your visit is not unexpected. My client recalled mentioning my services to you in a conversation some months ago, and predicted your appearance at my door, on account of her current venture.’

Mr Marlowe is about to interrupt the lawyer’s habitual long-winded argot, but Mr Mansfield cuts him short, as only a lawman used to proceedings in court can:

‘No, sir. Knowledge of my client’s affairs is sacrosanct. But I need not remind you, do I, Mr Marlowe? You are a man with his own battery of competent legal advisors, and with their assistance engage in many a transaction not fit for public scrutiny lest the opposition shall make hay with information they should not have. You, sir, will get nothing from me about Miss Marlowe that she has not sanctioned me to give.’

‘For God’s sake, man! What *can* you tell me?’

‘Other than that, she is well-provided for and, from what I gather, well-protected, as well. Did you not provide her with a manservant of considerable strength and versed in the martial arts required for the protection of a lady? Of course, you have. You have the lady’s interests at heart and will do all to preserve her honour. Her safety is a great concern of yours; it is my concern, too, sir. Let us be clear on that; Miss Marlowe is a most valued client for whom I shall do whatever she requires of me within the law.

‘Look, I do not have information on the exact points on her itinerary. I do, however, know some of the locations she intends to pass through. But *that* Miss Marlowe has unequivocally demanded of me to keep from everyone, and that includes *you*, sir – by express instructions of the lady herself.’

Mr Marlowe is seething, but a singular characteristic of his which prevents him from showing his emotional state, hides his anger and frustration. To keep the conversation going, as only a Socratic rhetorician like himself knows best how, he changes tack to keep the man talking, which might reveal more than he is prepared to say.

‘Miss Marlowe disclosed to me that she intended buying Hanstead Park from her grandfather Kemble, and that you would be closing the transaction on her behalf. Can you tell me anything more about this matter?’

‘I shall not give you the details pertaining to this purchase, sir, other than to reveal that, upon the deed soon to be registered in the public domain, Miss Marlowe will become the sole proprietor of said estate; and, I am pleased to report, to the complete satisfaction of her grandparents, who both shall have the right to reside at the Park for life. All parties involved have closed with me so that Miss Marlowe’s taking possession of Hanstead Park is all but complete.’

‘When was that? She’s only just turned eighteen a fortnight ago. Don’t tell me she’s spent her inheritance on *that!* When *did* you last see her?*’*

Mr Mansfield smiles indulgently, leans his portly arms on the bureau. ‘No, sir; Miss Marlowe has capital enough besides for the purpose. And as to your last question: very recently, sir; besides, the young lady has acquainted me with the fact that your guardianship was terminated by her – in writing. I can understand your concerns for her safely, Mr Marlowe, but your vested interests with regard to Miss Frieda Marlowe are ended, are they not?’

‘No, they are not!’ He looks at the attorney long and hard. ‘As her legal confidant, Mr Mansfield, I’ll tell you this. When I adopted Frieda, she became my sole heir, in law, and by birth. Her right to succeed at Endecott will not be disputed by any member of my family since Frieda Marlowe is in fact the child borne from my liaison with her mother Lady Finlay.’

‘Indeed! In that case, allow me to inform you, Mr Marlowe, that I am aware of Miss Marlowe’s paternal ancestry; she has informed me of it herself. And as her attorney, I should advise you, as I have advised her, to allow the matter to become public, in so far as it appertains to matters legal. But, Miss Marlowe was quite adamant that *you* were to make the disclosure, when you see fit. I think that *now*, sir, is the time fit to do so. And your own attorney should be duly acquainted so that your testament can be tailored accordingly.’

‘For God’s sake; we need to find her first. All this chatter about testaments is irrelevant till she is back safely where she belongs!’

‘Oh, I quite agree with you, sir; however—’ he smiles broadly at the thought, ‘Your reputation goes before you, Mr Marlowe, and if the young lady is anything like her father, she’ll be just fine, don’t you think?’

‘Hmph! You are not being very helpful, are you?’

‘I’ve given you all the help you can reasonable expect from me, Mr Marlowe. It is now up to you to apply your deductive powers in tracing her movements. But I promise you this: if at any time I should get a signal suggesting Miss Marlowe is or might be in unsurmountable difficulty, I shall be in touch directly. I have your card, and I have directions to your house here in Town and in the country.’

### Mr Mansfield alerts Mr Wallace Gascoyne

No sooner has Mr Marlowe departed from the offices of *Messrs Oberon and Mansfield* or the latter summons their court messenger to take a missive to the First Equity Bank for the particular attention of the bank’s principal official, its major shareholder and chief executive officer, Mr Wallace Gascoyne. The messenger, a fleet-footed clerk in his late teens, speeds from Whitechapel to the City on foot, taking every possible shortcut whilst making long strides as he runs into the bank’s premises, just in time to encounter Mr Gascoyne who is about to make his way to Devonshire Street, a jaunt to his home he is accustomed to performing at a brisk walk each evening, come rain or shine. He reads the missive, nods at the messenger and orders a hackney to take him to Whitechapel.

He and Mr Mansfield have a long, mostly fruitful discussion on Frieda Marlowe’s financial affairs. Frieda, being his niece, had put him in a tight spot on several occasions, especially with his wife, Sabina, who is Frieda’s godmother and had been the young lady’s mentor through many awkward moments on her path to adulthood.

The gist of the banker and the attorney’s deliberations involves Frieda’s legacy of ten thousand pounds, plus ten years’ accrued interest, which has been placed with the First Equity Bank, to be managed by her attorney, Mr Mansfield. Up to a fortnight ago, Mr Gascoyne had managed all of his niece’s pecuniary affairs, a task he had imposed on himself from the moment Frieda, at the tender age of eleven, had entrusted him with her birthday money, asking him to invest it for her as he saw fit. He had bought her shares in the emergent railway companies – a very shrewd investment that has continued to pay out handsome dividends and has allowed her capital to grow substantially with continued reinvestments. Besides, Frieda had also burdened him with a secret project of hers as a frequent contributor to the press for which she earns a pretty penny that has gone almost wholly into her portfolio of investments. As a consequence, before this inheritance of ten thousand fell due on her eighteenth birthday, Frieda, by English standards, was already a remarkably wealthy woman in her own right.

A fortnight ago, Frieda terminated his executorship of her affairs – having come of age, in accordance with the terms of the contract he had had drawn up on her behalf when she was still a minor. That she has transferred the management of her assets to an attorney of her own choice is perfectly normal; it has also relieved him, as a close family member, from the oft awkward duty of discretion required of him as her financial advisor. This task has now fallen to Mr Mansfield with whom, as the newly-appointed custodian of her fortune, he has been summoned to talk with regarding his niece’s latest venture; or, perhaps one ought to say, *adventure:* her setting off to the Continent in pursuit of a quest that at present only her attorney is privy to.

Mr Gascoyne, though, is becoming increasingly exasperated. Mr Mansfield will not be moved: the attorney is close-lipped on Frieda’s designs, nor will he disclose where amounts of money is to be transferred to. He, as her banker, is requested to deposit an amount with *Messrs Oberon and Mansfield* which, they, Mr Mansfield now informs him, will dispatch to predetermined locations allowing their client, Miss Marlowe, to have access to ready cash should she so require.

‘I empathise with your concerns, Mr Gascoyne; however, having gone over the subject of your niece’s proposed journey in some detail with her, and having come to the conclusion that my client is not only a very determined individual, but one of great intelligence, I am certain that she is able to conduct her own life most artfully.’

‘But how much information will you get – of her daily progress, or whatever! For heaven’s sake, sir; only a month ago she was a young girl, and ward to my brother-in-law. Yes, indeed, we are more aware than most of Miss Marlowe’s quickness, but let me tell you, we’ve also had to endure more than our fair share of her rashness. We *must* know where she is, and how she is doing. My wife will go spare with anxiety for her godchild’s safety. Tell us something – *anything* to give us peace of mind!’

‘My dear sir, I *cannot* comply with your request, as you are well aware. — Now, the chief purpose of my requesting your presence at these offices is to press upon you the need for discretion, especially regarding my client’s immediate family. I am particularly concerned about Mr Frank Marlowe who, as I have been explicitly instructed, is not to be given *any* information that I am in the know of which may reveal her intentions. You will, I am sure, receive a call from the gentleman soon; so, I beseech you to remain aloof to what you know about her pecuniary affairs; and, above all, I should caution you not to engage in wild speculations on where Miss Marlowe might conceivably be at present.’

### Frank writes to Lady Finlay

Frank Marlowe dips his pen in the inkwell, sits back immersed in thought. The pen poised, several minutes go by; he has to wet the nib again before he can write. *My dearest Claire,* he begins, then stops once more. *Where do I begin; what should I say that has not been said before? Our little treasure has grown up before our very eyes, a child no more. It is as if it were yesterday that she rode into Endecott on that frisky pony of hers: “When I grow up,” she said, “I shall ride a man’s saddle.” I laughed and said she would carry it off in style, little realising that the day we might call her* woman *was just a heartbeat away. I have failed in not anticipating her maturity beyond the niceties of everyday life. How could I not have seen that she would always want more, that she will demand of life much more than a safe haven at Endecott, or a sojourn in Town with her dear Sabina? I weep at the thought of the years and months that you were deprived of her company, to see that gangly blond wisp of a girl bloom. She is a child no more, untethered, an entity free from our desires to keep her and hold her. My dearest, you will have heard by now that she has flown yet again; yes! I say again, but I did not see it coming. With all that has gone before, how foolish of me not to foresee Frieda’s next hare-brained venture might be just round the corner. Where has she gone? I am at my wits end to find answers. Madame has not waited a minute beyond her eighteenth to establish her independence, and fly from the nest. She writes, “I beg of you to allow me to take possession of my majority in my own way.” And what for? To embark on a quest to discover the whereabouts of a person she has never met and with whom she has no affinity whatsoever? Only she can know what that means; in her own mind every thing is precisely formulated: what she wants, where she will go. She has no idea how vague it all seems to us, does she?*

Frank gives Claire an account of his visit with Mr Mansfield, and what he and Sabina had talked about. He deeply regrets not having had the gumption to tell Frieda about him earlier, about his relationship with her mother; why she had ended up at Endecott, why it was so very natural that she should be at the Manor, with *his* mother, her real grandmother, who has cared for her and loves her dearly: how will *she* not suffer knowing her dearest grandchild might be in danger? – and fret at him not having a notion where Frieda might be.

He concludes by asking for any information Claire might have that could shed light on Frieda’s supposed quest. He is about to end the letter when a messenger arrives at Hill Street from Sabina requesting his presence directly.

### Frank calls on Sabina again

‘Good of you to call so soon, brother. I may have some indication where our Frieda has gone off to; but, oh! here is Mr Gascoyne arrived as well.’ Turning to her husband she says:

‘Wallace, dear, I’ve delayed dinner by an hour so as to pass on my news to Frank. I’m quite sanguine that the mystery surrounding Frieda’s disappearance might turn out to be trivial, after all.’

‘All right,’ says he and addressing his brother-in-law, ‘Have you not engaged the police in searching for her?’

‘Yes, the City magistrate has his men watch all the main roads out of Town; besides, I’ve sent an express to Birmingham to inform the police of her last known location there. My own men, too, are enquiring at every coach station about her possible movements. She very likely passed through London for she must have met with her attorney at Whitechapel within the last twenty-four hours.’

‘Stern measures indeed! Gentlemen, the key to this riddle is quite obvious, requiring a less extravagant response. I think that Frieda is on her way to Dresden!’

‘What!’ pipes up both men in unison. ‘How did you arrive at that conclusion? And why did you not tell me before?’ Frank is quite vexed.

‘Hold your horses! It has occurred to me only this last hour that a letter I received one week ago from Fräulein Abeln – never mind! I shall explain *her* existence in a minute. Fräulein Abeln wrote to ask how she might go about obtaining permission for Frieda to attend her upcoming wedding in November. In truth, she should be most honoured if Frieda were her maid of honour on the day. Now, I’ve not had the opportunity to put it to you, Frank; nor have I had occasion to gauge Frieda’s opinion on the matter. However, only this afternoon, upon perusing the letter again did I descry a postscript to Fräulein Abeln’s letter, stating that she has extended a tentative invitation to Frieda herself. So there! What can be plainer than that?’

‘Thank God,’ says Wallace. ‘She did take a servant, *and* her lady’s maid, I hope.’

‘Yes, she has,’ says Frank drily. ‘A plausible scenario, my dear Sabina, were it not for a fundamental flaw pointing away from such a premise.’

‘Oh, and what can that be?’

Frank retrieves Frieda’s letter from his inside pocket and reads aloud: ‘“I embark on a quest to discover the whereabouts of a person I have never met and with whom I have no affinity whatsoever.”’

The Gascoynes fall silent, glance at each other, before directing a quizzical gaze at Frank.

‘What do you have in mind Frank – to be done, I mean?’ Wallace does not await his reply; he raises an indicative finger before continuing. ‘I might be able to secure you passage to Belgium at short notice, Frank – tomorrow, in fact. The *Sirius* leaves from the Docks for Antwerp at dawn. For all we know Frieda’s quest is tied up with Fräulein Abeln’s nuptials.’

‘My word, yes,’ says Sabina. ‘They’ve been keen correspondents these ten years. Heaven knows what they’ve concocted between them in the meantime. We all know what Frieda can get up to, don’t we? Frank, you must take up on Wallace’s offer; go to Germany. I’d sleep more easily knowing you are out there to watch over her. Eighteen indeed! She’s still a child, you know!’

‘Maybe so, but no ordinary child. Very well, this is what I propose. If she *is* going to Dresden, she’ll most likely pass through Cassel, about halfway. I shall travel to Cassel, enquire after her and if she *has* passed that way, I shall proceed to Dresden. Of course, if it is the wedding she’s gone for, she’ll not want us to fuss. Nonetheless, it is high time I speak to her about Claire and I. Frieda gleefully terminates my guardianship in her letter; but, as I’ve been informed by Mansfield, she knows about me, and will be well aware that my parental duties extend beyond her coming of age. I’ve been remiss in executing my duties towards Frieda; after me, she will be mistress of Endecott, the mines and everything associated with the estate – she ought to be cognisant of what that will entail, now that she’s eligible to inherit.’

After dinner Wallace orders a carriage from his own stables and goes directly to Town. He is acquainted with the owner of the *Sirius* and feels confident that he can arrange for his brother-in-law to be taken aboard on their next voyage to Cork via the Continent.

‘Sabina,’ says Frank, once Wallace has left, ‘you shall not withhold anything private between you and Frieda from me any longer. Who is this Fräulein Abeln? Tell me what you know, especially about her contacts – people I’ve not taken notice of before but, I dare say, ought to have.’

‘Frank dearest, you cannot induce me to be absolutely candid with you; there are matters of particular delicacy that will remain forever between her and me, and Claire, of course, where needs must. Honestly, Frank, you should remember the young lady whom I had come over to play the *holzharmonika* at Frieda’s eighth birthday. You even had her at Endecott for a while before she returned to Germany. She brought on Frieda’s mastery of the German language in leaps and bounds; so much so, that they remained firm pen-friends ever since.’

‘Oh, of course! That one. Mmm. I had no idea they corresponded, though. Who else, I wonder? Do you know?’

‘Well, there is Mr Buchholz, with whom she has remained in touch, as far as I know; and her sister, Eunice – though *she,* apparently, is dreadfully careless in replying to Frieda’s letters; and then there’s her grandmother, Lady Kemble, who dotes on her and lives for news from her beloved granddaughter. But, we must not forget Claire: there has been a veritable flood of letters going both ways between mother and daughter ever since you adopted her. Which brings me to something I’ve been meaning to tell you: I’m going to Finlay next week. I can go via Hanstead and ask what Lady Kemble knows, and then quiz Claire about her correspondence with Frieda when I get to Finlay.’

‘Excellent! Write to me, express, and direct your letters *poste restante, Cassel.* Anyone else?’

‘Not that I know of. Sometimes Frieda played her cards very close to her chest. I know nothing of her correspondence with her publisher, Mr Bainbridge. Moreover, there have been occasions when Frieda promised to write when we were abroad in France and, if I remember correctly, somebody in Spain – Zaragoza perhaps? I let these incidents wash over me when they occurred; after all, Frieda has her inimitable way of alluring people to communicate with her by post – I usually thought nothing more of it.

When Wallace returns at ten, Frank and he chat a while before he will return to Hill Street and prepare to leave at dawn for Antwerp.

‘Her lawyer, Mr Mansfield, has complete jurisdiction over her finances, has he? That’s the impression I got when we met.’

‘Yes, he does; and, I might add, much to my relief. I’m not keen on the idea of family being one’s own banker, or attorney. One has to be constantly on one’s guard about not revealing confidential information. However, her capital will remain at my bank. From now on Mr Mansfield will manage it on her behalf, instead of me.’

‘I dare say, you will be as reluctant as ever to reveal the extent of her worth; but, I should like to know what it amounts to. It is not uncommon for wealthy heiresses to make their gross worth public knowledge. But with Frieda, the public, and me, are none the wiser.’

Wallace laughs. ‘Indeed. Little Frieda has been a paragon of circumspection. If there is one thing she detests above all else, it is public attention, particularly from potential suitors. Young nubiles will advertise their wealth in order to attract eligible marriage partners; but not your Frieda: she eschews such attention most vigorously. It will not surprise me if she were to remain obscure from public scrutiny throughout her life; and if she ever marries, it will be of her own choosing.’

‘Sounds all very familiar to me, Wallace, but you are evading my question about her income. Give me some indication of its magnitude.’

‘Six figures, Frank; give or take one or two major expenditures she has engaged for lately. Purchasing Hanstead Park has taken a tidy chunk from her capital – not so as to drop it below six figures though.’

Frank whistles and grins self-indulgently. ‘I don’t know whether I should feel excessively proud or alarmed – both, I should imagine. A chip off the old block, my father might have said. I am a bit surprised, in all honesty, but not much. Can you give me some clues as to the sources of her wealth? Six figures! How extraordinary, for someone so young.’

‘You will recall the four hundred pounds you gave her for her eleventh birthday, from her legacy, I believe. Well, as I informed you at the time, she had asked me to invest it for her. I set up a portfolio with railway shares. Almost every penny she earned in dividends went straight back into more shares; also, not something you will be fully aware of – her income from journalism has been steadily growing over the years – again reinvested. At one point she surprised me by insisting I buy a piece of land in Bristol, and lo and behold, if not six month later the land is snapped up by the Great Western Company – at a whopping profit to Frieda. Also, part of the deal was in exchange for shares in the company. So, Frank, as you can see, Frieda is as astute in business as her father, and like her father, never blows her trumpet about her prowess in such matters.’

‘If I may be so bold, Wallace; it sounds a great deal like eggs in one basket. What if speculation on railway shares were to lead to a market crash? Conceivable, isn’t it? Will she stand to lose much?’

‘I’m glad you mention that. I put it to Frieda a year ago, and you know what she said? “Shipping, uncle Wallace, start diverting into shipping. We are a seafaring nation. England will one day be saturated with railway lines, but the oceans are vast, and trade with the East and the Americas will grow steadily no matter what.” And she’s right: somebody will have to build those ships, and once they’re built, shipping companies will set up a roaring trade across continents.

‘By the way, I do know this, Frank: I’ve been asked to deposit an amount with *Oberon and Mansfield* who will be dispatching cash deposits to different locations so that Frieda will have access to ready money. Don’t ask me where; Mansfield was mum about that. Once the money is with them, I can have no notion where it will be sent to.’

At this point their conversation tails off as Frank begs to be excused to go home and get a good night’s sleep before embarking on his journey to Cassel in Germany. He has an idea how he might discover where Frieda’s attorney will be sending her the money: a friend of a friend – there are many in commerce who owe him a favour. It is time to call in an unwritten IOU or two.

### Frank: London to Cassel

The *Sirius* began service in 1837 for the St George Steam Packet Company. Mainly employed as a cargo vessel, built for the London to Cork route, she can carry forty passengers. With a two-cylinder steam engine driving two sidewheels, she can cruise steadily at a speed of twelve knots. Mr Gascoyne has secured passage on the steam packet for his brother-in-law, including his valet, Mr Trelawny, and his most trusted coachman, Jiles Malcolm – a gnarled block of a man pushing fifty years of age, but as spry as any man half his age.

The *Sirius* makes the crossing to Belgium in quick time. The three of them go ashore at Antwerp seventeen hours after having left London at daybreak. Frank Marlowe manages to hire a carriage before midnight and they depart directly for Dortmund, the first leg of their journey to Cassel.

Six days after departure from London, Frank Marlowe and two servants arrive at Cassel in *das Kurfürstentum Hessen,* a principality in the Grand Duchy by the same name. There is plenty of light left in the day, but no sign or hint of Frieda anywhere, from all quarters: at the *Gasthaus*, or the *Remise*, the coach shed where horses might be changed – not a thing. Nobody is able to recount a lady fitting that description, nor accompanying servants that might remotely match the likenesses given, ever passing into or out of the town. Mr Trelawny, being conversant in the German tongue, is sent out on his own, to search out any likely locations round about Cassel – but to no avail.
